PLAN
----

Building an AI to play Streetfighter 2.

Tournament-style simulation between all characters. 

Each character would have to train against all other characters as part of the training process, and would be re-run for a certain amount of games at a time. Some players will probably win more games than others due to the possible effectiveness of character specific skills with the mechanics of the game.

Casting as a reinforcement learning problem, the AI will make observations about the world, select an action to take and then received a reward for that action.

We need to define our observations, actions and our rewards.
...


SETUP
-----
need to automate the menu options to start the simulation, and restart games
- this should be straightforward -> check action space, and coordinate button presses needed to start the game for each frame/timestep
= well no, a state with each character starting the arcade is created, this is then loaded as the default for which we can train each player, so need for automating button presses in the menu

- see if i can place variables in the info.json file to use in corresponding DONE
- create code template first to run the game, random actions for 200 steps (after initial setup to load the game) DONE
- get sf2 (exact version) rom DONE
- buy the game...

- will have to use the integration tool to find the memory locations of the variables needed...


i want to setup my own game, and it looks like sf2 genesis version is already setup, so play around with this, and then integrate sf2 gba version so i can say integrated this myself
