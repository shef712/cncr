Initial Aim:
Develop my own original solution to a machine learning problem.

Empirical research is based on observed and measured phenomena and derives knowledge from actual experience rather than from theory or belief.
Systematically conduct a substantial empirical inquiry using research methods and analysis techniques appropriate to the field of research and level of study.
(Comparison to random agent and human-level players, look at atari papers for analysis techniques and research methods)

Aspect of originality: applying a Q-Network to Street Fighter II using  open AI.

Format report reqady to submit to target journal:
International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
A manuscript is a type of technical report that enables the reader to evaluate the work and, if necessary, repeat the research. If the reader canâ€™t repeat the procedures exactly, the report is inadequate for purposes of science.  Empirical findings, to be admissible into the body of science, must be amenable to retesting. 

Written dissertation (5-6,000 words)

ABSTRACT
--------


Discussion (Conclusion)
----------
"In this section, discuss, interpret, and draw conclusions from your results in relation to your statement of the problem (and hypotheses). Here you consider the meaning of the results. 
Avoid simply re-describing the data.
The results should be discussed in relation to the issues raised in the introduction and to the procedures used to obtain them. Apparent discrepancies within the data that are not clear from inspection of the tables and figures may also be explained. 
This section also indicates how a better study might be conducted; for example, you may outline further studies that are suggested by the outcome of the present one. In this manner, discrepancies, inconsistencies and sources of error can be discussed. If the results disagree with previous findings of similar research studies, you should try to account for the discrepancies. This section also gives you with a chance to demonstrate independent thinking. //Evaluation"

Mention one of the reasons that more trials was not trained on was because the agent would forget combo's like "down slide and medium kick", 

Mentiom tahat the technique for down slide is very specific to Bison, and i'm sure other characters trained with would find other instant and quick attacks, though there would be a definite down-side to this if a human player realises that the agent spams this move a lot and counters effectively.




Talk about defending would have been a good technique to learn.

maybe hyper parameters were bad

design decision could have been better?



if i have 4000+ words i'll be fine


LITERATURE REVIEW
-----------------
"Your Project Supervisor will have read and provided detailed feedback on the Literature Review that was submitted as part of the Proposing Research in Psychology module.
Literature review: include gyroscope's work for streetfighter using BizHawk (reference to the article or tool), also other open ai's envs that have been solved using QN or DQN (e.g. atari, mountaincar, cartpole)
Include in appendix.
Word count counts towards the total word count of the project."


YOUTUBE LINK
------------
Play "theres no easy way out" throughout a match that beats guile, ken and close with chunli (best i've seen basically). Link channel in report so i can upload and edit the video on the weekend.
- Add on personal youtube channel "Shaf Liaquat"
